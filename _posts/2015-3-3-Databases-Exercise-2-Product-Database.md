Exercise 2 in Databases required us to create and fill a product database utilising as little repetitiveness than possible. I accomplished this task by taking the tables into normal form 3 and using foreign keys for relaying connected information.

The table can be viewed and tested on [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/e3fde) or right here for just viewing:
