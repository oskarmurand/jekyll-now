As I wrote previously, I created this site on Github Pages using Jekyll. The cool thing with Jekyll is that you can extend it fairly easily with plugins (*and other people have made these*) The sad factor of this approach is that Github limits the usage of Jekyll plugins to [about a handfull](https://pages.github.com/versions/) on its Pages.

Luckily for me (before I started getting my hands dirty), I did the sensible thing and Googled which lead me to this nice post on minddust about ["How to use tags and categories on Github Pages without plugins"](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/). This is exactly what I needed.

The only problem is that this does not completely work for me - thus I am still in search for a solution that works.
